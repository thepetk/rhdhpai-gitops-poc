# RHDHPAI Rolling Demo GitOps

The repository contains the gitops resources required to deploy an instance of the RHDHPAI rolling demo. The project is currently live at [rolling-demo-backstage-rolling-demo-ns.apps.rosa.redhat-ai-dev.m6no.p3.openshiftapps.com](https://rolling-demo-backstage-rolling-demo-ns.apps.rosa.redhat-ai-dev.m6no.p3.openshiftapps.com).

## Contents

The rolling demo combines the following components so far:

- The [AI software templates](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template), a collection of Software Templates based on AI applications.
- The [AI homepage](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/ai-integrations/plugins/ai-experience), provides users with better visibility into the AI-related assets, tools and resources.
- The [Model Catalog Bridge](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/model-catalog-bridge) and the [catalog-backend-module-rhdh-ai](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/rhdh-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/rhdh-ai/plugins/catalog-backend-module-rhdh-ai) plugin. This mechanism provides a way to facilitate the seamless export of AI model records from Red Hat OpenShift AI and imports them into Red Hat Developer Hub (Backstage) as catalog entities.

## Capabilities & Limitations

### Access

- Access to the rolling demo is provided through Red Hat SSO.
- Every authenticated user has access to the AI software templates from the catalog. That said, you are able to choose the template you prefer and give it a try.

### AI Software Templates

- Currently our demo doesn't support deployment which require GPU.
- The rolling demo, currently supports only Github deployments. That said, you cannot use `Gitlab` as `Host Type` when installing the template.
- The github organization set to serve the demo is `ai-rolling-demo`, that said you need to keep it as the `Repository Owner`.
- Same applies for the `Image Organization` value. The `quay.io` repository corresponding to the demo is `rhdhpai-rolling-demo`.

### Model Catalog Bridge

- A pre-requisite for the model catalog bridge to work is a running Red Hat OpenShift AI instance, so the bridge can fetch all registered models and add them to RHDH as catalog entities.

### Limited Application Lifecycle

- In order to avoid overprovisioning of resources, the rolling demo uses a `pruner` cronjob that deletes all Software Template applications that are older than 24 hours. That means that all the openshift **and** github resources (deployments, repositories, argocd applications, etc.) are removed.

## Rolling demo setup

Some instructions on how to setup an instance of the rolling demo on your own can be found in [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](./docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot login to the rolling demo

If it is your first time accessing our cluster, keep in mind that we have an automation in place to register new users, so you might have to wait a few minutes for this process to be completed. If, after your second attempt you still have a problem accessing the rolling demo instance you please ping `team-rhdhpai` in the `#forum-rhdh-plugins-and-ai` slack channel.
